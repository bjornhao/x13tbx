To be able to use the toolbox with the default options, you need at least this file
	x13as_ascii.exe
in this directory. The toolbox will attempt to download this from the US Census website if it is not available.

In addition, more programs from the US Census might be automatically installed here if you use non-standard options.
	x13as_html.exe
	x12a.exe
	x12a64.exe
	x12diag03.exe
	zlib1.dll
	libjpeg.6.dll
	libpng3.dll
	X11Q2.exe
	X11SS.exe
